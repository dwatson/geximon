geximon 0.7

  by David Watson and Gintautas Miliauskas <gintas@pov.lt>

>>> Introduction <<<

  geximon is a replacement for eximon, the exim server monitor. The original
  program is functional, but, to cite one of the exim mailing list members,
  "it could use a visit from one of the Learning Channel redecoration shows
  :-)".
  
  geximon is written in Python and is based on Gtk2. The source code is
  available under the GNU General Public Licence. This is a development
  version, so your mileage may vary, however, there should not be any
  serious breakage. If you happen to come across a bug, please take the time
  to drop me an e-mail.
  
  You will need Python[1] (version >= 2.2) and a recent version of pygtk[2].
  Of course, you will need exim[3] (version 3 or 4) installed as well. If
  exim is installed in a non-standard location, you will need to specify the
  paths in geximon preferences.

  This version has been tested with Debian testing and unstable.


>>> Installation <<<

  You may run the program by running `geximon.py` in the geximon
  directory.  Moreover, as this program is packaged using distutils, you can
  easily install it by running `./setup.py install` as the superuser. A
  script named `geximon` will be placed in your path which you can then use
  to invoke the program.

  If you are using a Debian-based operating system, you should use the Debian
  package rather than distutils. The package is available at the website.


  More documentation is available in HTML format in the `doc/` subdirectory.
  It should also be accessible from geximon through the Help menu.
