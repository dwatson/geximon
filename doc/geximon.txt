1. Introduction

   geximon is a replacement for eximon, the exim server monitor. The
   original program is functional, but, to cite one of the exim mailing
   list members, "it could use a visit from one of the Learning Channel
   redecoration shows :-)".

   geximon is written in Python and is based on Gtk2. The source code is
   available under the GNU General Public Licence. This is a development
   version, so your mileage may vary, however, there should not be any
   serious breakage. If you happen to come across a bug or if you have
   any suggestions, please take the time to drop me an e-mail to
   <[6]gintas@pov.lt>.

   You will need [7]Python (version >= 2.2) and a recent version of
   [8]pygtk. Of course, you will need [9]exim (version 3 or 4) installed
   as well. If exim is installed in a non-standard location, you will
   need to specify the paths in geximon preferences.
     _________________________________________________________________

2. Installation

   You may run the program by running geximon.py in the geximon
   directory. Moreover, as this program is packaged using distutils, you
   can easily install it by running ./setup.py install as the superuser.
   A script named geximon will be placed in your path which you can then
   use to invoke the program.
     _________________________________________________________________

3. Configuration

   geximon stores its configuration in the file .geximonrc in the user's
   home directory. Most settings as well as window positions are saved in
   this file in a human-readable format, however, there should be no need
   to edit it manually.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.1. Privileges

   geximon needs privileges to communicate with exim and to read its
   logs. The easiest solution is to run the program as the superuser.

   If you are concerned about security, and prefer to run the program as
   an ordinary user, there are a few things you can do. Adding yourself
   to 'mail' and 'adm' groups might give enough priviledges to see the
   exim queue (try /usr/sbin/exim -bp) and to read the main logfile
   (/var/log/exim/mainlog). However, the process list will not be
   available (it needs to run /usr/sbin/exiwhat).

   You can also use sudo (a program that allows controlled permission
   elevation) to great effect. You will need to configure sudo not to ask
   for a password for some commands. As the superuser, execute visudo to
   edit the sudo configuration file (/etc/sudoers), and add this line:

   your_username ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/exim, /usr/sbin/exiwhat

   [For more information about the file syntax, see the manual page of
   sudoers(5).]

   Now, in geximon preferences, check the 'Use sudo' option. The changes
   should take effect immediately after applying the preferences window:
   the queue list and process list should start working. Note that you
   will still not be able to kill exim processes from geximon, to do that
   you must run geximon itself as the superuser.

   Components that lack permissions to function properly should not
   interfere with others (e.g. if you can read the logfile, the log
   should be shown even if the queue can not be listed.)
     _________________________________________________________________

4. Usage

   The user interface should be fairly intuitive. One thing that might
   not be apparent at first glance is that messages with ID's highlighted
   in red are frozen, which means that they could not be delivered, but
   delivery will be attempted after some time passes.

   Context menus are available in the queue list and the process list.
   You may hold down Ctrl to select multiple items and use Shift to
   select ranges; Ctrl+A marks all items.

   If the confirmation and report popups annoy you, they can be turned
   off in preferences.

   eximstats and exigrep are two quite useful utilities that are bundled
   with exim. They can be invoked through the 'Exim' menu. exigrep can
   also be invoked on fields of messages by using the context menu of the
   queue list.

   You can choose the text wrapping mode in the context menu of
   textboxes.

   If you are told a message is locked, it means that it is being
   processed by exim. To unlock it, you may want to use the process list
   to seek out the exim instance that is currently dealing with the
   message and send it a SIGTERM. The exim instance will terminate and
   the message should now be unlocked.

   The plots have the same meanings as in the original eximon. The label
   colors correspond to the line colors. The number next to a label is
   the last value for that plot, visual scaling (if >1) is shown in
   brackets. If you see a single line only, it's probably because it
   simply overdraws the other lines.

   When the process list is enabled, exiwhat is invoked regularly (the
   interval can be specified in preferences). Each run may produce a
   short but noticeable spike in CPU usage, so closing the window when it
   is not in use is a good idea.
