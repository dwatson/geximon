  * The GUI should be more responsive while the queue display is being
    updated. Also, large queues should be handled much faster. Thanks to
    Laurent Martelli for input regarding this issue.
  * Now depending on exim4-base rather than exim4. Again thanks to Laurent
    Martelli for pointing this out.
